# WritableStream

Data begins to travel through a stream once it is been piped, with the [pipeTo][] function, in to a sink. The sink's [write][] function will be called per "chunk". The [write][] function will only be called again when it's optional, returned [Promise][] resolves.

```typescript
new WritableStream({
  async write(chunk) {
    await doSomething(chunk)
  },
})
```
