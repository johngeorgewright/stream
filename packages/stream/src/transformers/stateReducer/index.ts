 * ------------{'add author','Jane Austin'}----------------------------

 * stateReducer({

 * // The State will be the type of data you want to manipulate.
 * interface State {
 *   authors: string[]

 *
 * // The Actions are a record of "action name" to a parameter.
 * // If the action doesn't require a parameter, use `void`.
